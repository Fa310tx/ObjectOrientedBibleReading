# Daily Bible Reading
This is an UNOFFICIAL app for joining with Faith Life Church's (http://www.flcbranson.org) Daily Bible Reading program (http://flcbranson.org/php/mlmBibleReading.php?site=flcb&pageKey=head4).
The current version supports Windows Phone 8, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Mobile.

It allows you to read each day's chapter (or have it read to you), as well as the surrounding days' chapters (although that is discouraged).
You can see what chapters you have already read (read chapters are dimmed) and which chapter is today's (unique background).
A single verse can be selected and shared through Window's built-in share contracts.
There are multiple Bible versions available to choose from (KJV, NIV, etc...) and that preference will be seen on all devices.
The font size is adjustable and that preference will only affect that device.
Preferences are stored in your roaming profile, so they will remain if you uninstall/reinstall or hard-reset your device (assuming you keep the same device name).

Please remember that I'm a hobbyist programmer (no real training).
Someone more knowledgable, than me, will laugh at a lot of my code, but it's where I'm at (this is the 3rd generation of the app - you should see the 1st).
Feel free to give me guidance on best practices.
JJ
